Integrating the Supreme Head Module

To integrate the Supreme Head module into the existing swarm code, we need to ensure that it has the appropriate access and control over all swarm assets and agents. Here's the code to accomplish this:

1. Modify the Swarm Class

In the existing Swarm class, we need to add a reference to the Supreme Head module and provide it with appropriate access and control. Here's an example of how it can be done:

Python

Copy Code

class Swarm:

def __init__(self):

self.agents [] # Existing list of a self.assets = [] # Existing list of a self.protocols = [] # Existing list of self.supreme_head = SupremeHead() # R

# Other existing code

# Existing methods.

def add_agent(self, agent):

self.agents.append(agent) self.supreme_head.add_agent (agent) #

def remove_agent(self, agent): self.agents.remove(agent)

self.supreme_head.remove_agent(agent)

# Similar methods for adding/removing asse

In this modified code, we added a supreme_head attribute to the Swarm class, which holds a reference to the Supreme Head module. Whenever an agent is added or removed from the swarm, we also update the Supreme Head module accordingly.

2. Implement the Supreme Head Module

Now, let's implement the Supreme Head module itself. This module will have access and control over all swarm assets and agents. Here's an example implementation:

Python

class SupremeHead:
