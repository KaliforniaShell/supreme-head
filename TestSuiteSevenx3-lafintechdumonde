Input: Introduce errors in the financial data or instructions.

Output: Verify that the AI detects and handles errors appropriately, such as providing error messages or failing gracefully without crashing.

3. Test Case: Performance

Input: Provide a large dataset with a high number of financial transactions and complex instructions.

Output: Measure the execution time of the AI and ensure that it performs within acceptable performance limits.

4. Test Case: Edge Cases

Input: Test the AI with extreme or unexpected inputs, such as very high or very low values, unusual data patterns, or unusual instructions.

Output: Verify that the AI handles these edge cases correctly and produces reasonable outcomes.

5. Test Case: Integration

Input: Integrate the AI with other components of the system, such as external APIs or databases.

Output: Verify that the AI interacts correctly with the integrated components and produces the expected outcomes.

6. Test Case: Security

Input: Test the AI with malicious inputs, such as attempts to inject code or manipulate the financial data.

• Output: Verify that the AI has appropriate security measures in place to detect and

prevent such attacks, such as input

validation and sanitization.

These test cases cover different aspects of the AI's functionality and help ensure that it performs correctly and reliably in various scenarios. It is important to develop a comprehensive test suite that covers different use cases and edge cases to increase confidence in the AI's performance and accuracy.
